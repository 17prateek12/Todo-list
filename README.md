# Todo-list

This project is using ReactJS, Django, and MongoDB. The frontend application is made with React hooks, which are running on localhost:3000, and the backend has been created using the Djangorest framework, which is running on server 127.0.0.1:8000, which is on MongoDB port 27017. The user can add to-do work to a list, mark it complete, filter complete and active work, delete work, and edit work, and most importantly, all will be reflected in the Djangorest server and MongoDB database.
